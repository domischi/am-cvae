# AM-CVAE
This program is used to fit a convolutional variational auto encoder on a set of images. The first iteration (the current state) operates on MNIST, but the goal of the project is to have data handlers written for arbitrary image input.

Feel free to use the code to play with your systems.

Please note that the code is based on a tutorial by [Google](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae) and another one posted on the [Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html). So if something works, credit it to them, if something fails, blame me.
